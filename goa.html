        One of Goa's most famous beaches, Colva attracts crowds of tourists during high season (mid-November through
        mid-February) â€” for good reason. The 2.4-kilometer-long beach in south Goa offers an endless array of aquatic
        adventure sports (including jet skiing, banana boat rides, and parasailing), sand that's as soft and as white as
        baby powder, and a well-developed tourism infrastructure that can cater to your every need. See for yourself at
        the incredible beach resorts in this area.

        Colva Beach is a favorite among Indian tourists, so if you're looking for a local experience, you'll find it
        here. Consider staying overnight at one of the many homestay accommodations offered by families in the village
        for an even more authentic trip.

        When you've had enough sun, head just a few minutes inland for sanctuary at Our Lady of Mercy Church. The
        white-washed spiritual center in the village square was founded in the 1600s and houses a famous statue of an
        infant Jesus that reportedly has healing powers. The attraction draws countless pilgrims from around the world
        for the traditional Fama celebration every October.

    <h2>
        Dona Paula Beach
    </h2>

        Dona Paula Beach is one of the best beaches in Goa for honeymoon tourists. Nicknamed "Lovers' Paradise," this
        coastal destination in the suburbs of Panaji even has its own love legend.

        The tale is about Dona Paula, the daughter of a Portuguese viceroy, who threw herself into the Arabian Sea after
        her father forbade her from seeing a Goan fisherman who had stolen her heart. The viceroy was so saddened by the
        loss of his young daughter that he named this entire beautiful area after her, and treated it as a tribute to
        eternal romance.

        It's easy for modern-day tourists to fall in love with this pretty beach. It's got calm waters and bronze sand
        shaded by palm trees, along with a relaxing vibe that begs you to stick around for sunset. It's also well served
        by a range of accommodations, including boutique hotels and luxury beach resorts, that will make you feel right
        at home.
