        If you are someone who loves to visit beaches that are bustling with people and activities, then this beach is
        the ideal picnic spot for you. However, the beach is also a decent attraction for people who seek quietude. The
        area around the lighthouse is quite peaceful and deserted. The beach is primarily a bathing beach and even has a
        religious connotation.

        Location: Swargadwar Rd, Odisha
        Famous For: Sri Chaitanyadev, a sage used to bathe at this beach and so it is an eminent religious place.
